
notes

1. data needed to be masked - gazillion 0s
2. concepts are not unique within a session - some concepts appear more than once, some don't appear in all sessions
3. hbo / hbr values are sometimes all over the place; there's clearly lots of noise depending
4. should probably take the difference between the rest period and the actual stimulus
